package parser

/*
Parers take source code as input (either as text or tokens)
and produce a data structure which represents this source
code. While building up the data structure, they unavoidably
analyse the input, checking that it conforms to the expected
structure. Thus the process of parsing is also called syntactic analysis.
The parser below is a recursive descent parser also called top down
operator precedence parser, sometimes called Pratt Parser.
